# Rust Mathematics
A repository of examples for mathematics in Rust. This repository primarily exists as a place for me to improve my mathmatics and problem solving skills. If you find any code you wish to use, then go ahead!

## But why Rust?
I'm using Rust as the programming language to improve my mathemetical skills for the following reasons:
- Almost as fast as standard C.
- Easy to use and compact.
- Building executable files is straight forward.
- It's helping me learn Rust as well as re-cover some of the basic fundlementals of Mathematics simultaneously.

## To-Do List
- [x] Basic trigonometry.
- [x] Factorials.
- [x] Averages.
- [x] Square root.
- [ ] Project Euler - First 10 Archieves


## Credits
Some of the maths problems I've used are universal; they are common knowledge and do not belong to anyone. However, there are also problems taken from Project Euler which can be found at: https://projecteuler.net/archives
